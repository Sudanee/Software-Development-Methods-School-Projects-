# School-Projects
All projects were complied using vagrant and git, written in languages Python or C.
Files a1, a2, and a3 are projects that all had me take information from a xml file and summerize in the same way as the test files.
File a4 is a art generator, I had to write code that had to create random shapes with random colors and sizes.
